# Local

Project from 2017, Android application that uses GPS signal and Google database to locate catering and service companies in the area.
An application provides user basic information about specific company and points the way to certain one.
Additional functionality is to allow the user to save locations that he is interested in locally on his device. 
An application has been made in Java programming language using Google API and Realm Database technology.
Google API keys probably have expired.
